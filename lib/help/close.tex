\subsection{CLOSE}
Frees the resources associated with an open cursor.
After the cursor is closed, no subsequent operations are allowed on it.
A cursor should be closed when it is no longer needed.
An implicit close is executed for every open cursor when a transaction is terminated by
\htmlref{COMMIT}{commit}
or
\htmlref{ROLLBACK}{rollback}
.
