\section{Diagrams}
The \emph{Diagrams} tab allows for concept modeling of your database tables, 
and graphically showing the links between tables. Basically, they let you 
make pretty pictures for the boss. Diagrams used to be called Schemas, but 
the name was changed to prevent confusion with the introduction of the SCHEMA 
into PostgreSQL 7.3

Try adding a couple of tables to the diagram. You will see them appear on the 
canvas, in a style similar to the 
\htmlref{Visual Query Builder}{visual_designer} 
but with a little more color. By dragging one column in a table to another 
column in a different table, links can be created.

You can group tables by holding \emph{Control} and clicking on the names of 
the tables. Then, these tables will move as a group.

To move the entire display, click and hold the canvas, out side of a table, 
while moving the mouse.

Diagrams can be saved, and also printed as postscript.
