\section{Views}
The \emph{Views} tab is used to manipulate VIEWS, which are looked upon as
tables within the database. Queries can be created, and saved as views, which 
allow for users to be granted only specific snapshots of data that they need 
to do their jobs, instead of granting a user rights on several tables.
