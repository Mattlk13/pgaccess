\section{Graphs}
Graphs provide a simple mechanism for visualizing your table or view data, 
as either bar or line graphs.  Both the \emph{x} and \emph{y} axis are pulled 
from the database.  For the \emph{x} axis, the values stored in the selected 
column are retrieved as \emph{x} axis labels.  For the \emph{y} axis, any 
number of columns in the chosen table may be displayed, under the 
\emph{Series} title.

Data Series can be added and removed by clicking on the plus or minus buttons 
next to the listbox. The color of each data series may be changed by clicking 
on the colorwheel button.

A range of the \emph{x} and \emph{y} axis may be selected by using the spin 
boxes provided, as well as the table source of the graph.  Note that the 
\emph{y} axis will have values that are split evenly, considering the max 
and min y range as well as the size of the graph.
