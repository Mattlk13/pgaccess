\section{PgAckages}
PgAckages are a PgAccess specific file format designed to ease the installation 
of small applications and to make your database more portable. Several examples 
reside in the demo/ directory -- with the extension .pga -- for you to try.

If you combine the use of PgAckages with the \emph{-temp} command line option, 
which only creates TEMPorary PgAccess tables, you can keep all the 
\emph{lint} from PgAccess out of your production database system.
Connect to your database, create some queries, save them as a PgAckage, 
then load that package on start-up each time you connect.
