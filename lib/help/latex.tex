\subsection{\LaTeX}
The \LaTeX  parser is in continuous development, it now can parse just one 
enviroment level in depht. More advanced features are planned in the near
future.

After translating all the .hlp files in .tex files, new discussions will
follow on how to rewrite or enhance the parser.

The target is to make the parser understand all the latex commands and to 
respond properly on them, i.e. format the output properly.
