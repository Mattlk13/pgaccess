\section{The New PgAccess Team}
The torch was handed over most gracefully by Constantin Teodorescu, and 
development continues on PgAccess with a new team of developers.
We want to continue to make PgAccess the best looking and most powerful 
GUI for PostgreSQL.

The core team and their primary areas of expertise:

\textbf{Bartus Levente}  - Functions, Language Translations

\textbf{Brett Schwartz}  - New Interface, Multiple Connections

\textbf{Chris Maj}       - Forms, Reports

\textbf{Iavor Raytchev}  - Coordination, Webmaster
