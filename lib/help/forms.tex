\section{Forms}
The \emph{Forms} tab is used to inspect, create and design
database stored forms that can be later executed.

Forms are actually Tcl/Tk code stored in the opened database in a special table called
\emph{pga\_forms} and they can be executed by selecting it and pressing the
\emph{Open} button.

The design module will allow you do define the graphical layout of the form and
to bind Tcl/Tk code to different widgets. You will really need to know Tcl/Tk in
order to be able to write PgAccess forms.
