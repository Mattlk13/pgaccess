\subsection{Creating a new query}
Select the \emph{Queries} tab from the main window and press the \emph{New} button.

You will need to enter the query name and the SQL command for the query. If you
desire, you could use the \htmlref{visual query designer}{visual_designer}.

You can design dynamic queries that can include a parameter that will be
provided later at query execution time by using the
\texttt{[parameter "message"]} function as in the following examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Example 1:} \texttt{select * from people where age <= [parameter "Maximum age?"]}
\item{Example 2:} \texttt{select * from invoices where received\_date = '[parameter "Invoice date?"]'}
\end{itemize}

Before query execution a popup dialog will be displayed in order to get that parameter and to substitute it in the query command.

Checking the \emph{"save this query as a view"} checkbox will create a new view from the current query.
