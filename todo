Things that have to be done in the near future:

Translations:
    * use of the *intlmsg* function in every place
    * translation in the different languages

Forms:
    * query widget: return value of the open procedure that shows if the query
    finished with or without error (good for error handling) -bartusl
    * new widgets -bartusl
    * pack and grid arangements -bartusl
    * convert more widgets to BWidgets -cmaj
    * create new "formdata" column in the pga_forms table to store the formdata
    separately from the formsource. The formdata can be easily lost. -bartusl

Open database form:
    * list of the available databases and let the user choose one -bartusl

Reports:
    * add grouping and sorting -cmaj

Syntax highlight:
    * refresh highlight on insert or delete -bartusl

Visual Query Builder:
    * needs to be adopted by someone and kept up-to-date -cmaj

Icons:
    * add more of them across the app for a more consistent look -cmaj

Library procedures (that can be used in the pgaccess API):
    * sort of API::intlmsg for multiple language support (pga_ml_main, pga_ml_translations table?)
    with -quiet/noquiet switches to alert when translation is not found -bartusl
    * multilanguage help files support (pgaccess style) -bartusl

Other features:
    * short label for the new/open/design/... icons that can be hidden eventualy -bartusl
    * support for other postgresql objects: -bartusl
	- triggers
	- aggregates
	- foreign keys
	- ?
    * drop database support -bartusl
    * respect user preferences, pg/pga tables, fonts, etc. -cmaj
	
Functions:
    * run function after setting up the parameter list -bartusl
    * copy functions -bartusl

Documentation:
    * source code documentation -bartusl
    * API documentation -bartusl    
    * tutorials -bartusl

Other:
    * separate the required packages from the source
    and create dependencies -bartusl
