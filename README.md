pgAccess
========

pgAccess is a graphical interface to PostgreSQL database written in Tcl/Tk and applications building environment.
Currently, this project on SF is not actively maintained, but the published versions do work.
This is one of the best PostgreSQL administration tool and I have descided to move the source here and try to revive the project again.
